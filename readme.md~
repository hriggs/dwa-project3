## Description
The Project 3 Developer's Best Friend site is for the class CSCI E-15: Dynamic Web Applications. 
This site includes 3 tools. First, a tool to generate a random number of paragraphs of lorem ipsum 
text (with optional other types of text). Second, a tool to generate random user data; this includes
the user's name and optionally an address, phone number, e-mail, birthday, and profile lorem ipsum 
blurb. Finally, it contains a tool that generates a xkcd password with various options such as 
symbols and numbers distributed throughout or at the end of the password.
